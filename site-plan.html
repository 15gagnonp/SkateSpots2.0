        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Have you ever moved to or visited a new city and didn’t know the best local spots? This especially happens to skateboarders. When a skater moves somewhere or visit a new city they need some help finding the best local spots. I am a web developer and a skater and know this to be a common problem.  Rather than making skaters go to the local skate shop, I want to make a website that would help skaters find the best skate spots right when they get to a new area or even before they arive! </p>  <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This website will focus mostly on students at BYU-I that skateboard. Because of how many people come and go from Rexburg because of the school there are a lot of people that need help finding the best places to skate. I have noticed that college students are in a phase where they start trying a lot of new things. One of these things ends up being skateboarding and there are a lot of people in Rexburg that are looking to skate outside of the skatepark. Not only new skaters, but seasoned skaters. The main focus will be on the students, but there is also a group of skaters that are from Rexburg that this website could help. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        <h3>The Spots</h3>
        <p>
          What I need to know?
  If you have not done a lot of street skating before here are a few tips!
  •	Skate with a buddy, street spots are a lot more dangerous then skateparks because they were not originally meant to be skated. This increases the risk of injury. Because of this it is always good to have a buddy. 
  •	Buy skate wax! While many of these spots are already waxed up sometimes they get sticky after being skated. It is always good to bring wax especially if want to session the ledges. Concrete street ledges tend to need to be re-waxed fairly often. 
  •	If you are in need of a skateboard or anything from a skateshop there are three options. One shop in town call the Sled Shed, but it is more of a snowboarding/biking shop. The Skate shop to go to is in the Idaho falls mall. There are two, The Nayborhood and Zumiez. I would definitely suggest The Nayborhood.
